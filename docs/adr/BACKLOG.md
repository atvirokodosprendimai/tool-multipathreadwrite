# Backlog — what is not yet an ADR

Deferred work and open questions, each naming the record that punted it. An
entry here is a receipt: a deferral whose pointer names this file but never
wrote anything into it passes every check and exists nowhere, so the entry is
written in the same commit as the deferral.

`adr-debt docs/adr` sweeps the deferrals in the records and expects to find them
here.

## From ADR-001 (a plan addresses the original file)

- **Streaming or memory-bounded application for very large files.**
  `internal/apply` reads whole files into memory and splits them into lines.
  Measured 2026-08-31 on a 14 MB / 200,000-line file: five hunks applied in
  0.15 s, a narrow ranged read in 0.03 s. Fine at that size, unbounded in
  principle. No decision needed until a real file makes it hurt — record the
  size that does.

- **A `cmd N` registry of saved commands addressable by number.** Proposed
  2026-08-31 alongside the `@N` file pointers, deliberately not built: a shell
  command invoked by number is unreadable at the call site, so a wrong number
  runs the wrong thing with nothing to inspect. The safe variant is saved
  *plans* (`mrw write @p1`), which stay inspectable artifacts. Undecided.

## From ADR-002 (mrw will not edit a file it has not seen)

- **`mrw forget <path>`.** `seen.Forget` is implemented and tested but has no
  CLI caller — dead code until wired. Either wire it or delete it; leaving an
  unreachable exported function is the "finished and unreachable" shape this
  workspace keeps finding.

- **Pruning ledger entries for deleted files.** `.mrw/seen` grows by one short
  line per path read and nothing removes entries for files that no longer
  exist. Harmless at current sizes; no measurement taken.

## From ADR-003 (a check's verdict comes from the process)

- **Cleaning up the temp output files.** Each `--check` run leaves a
  `mrw-check-*.log` in the system temp directory. It is named in the report so
  the caller can read it, and nothing deletes it. Options: delete on success and
  keep on failure, or move them under `.mrw/`.

- **Scope derivation for languages other than Go.** `{packages}` is derived by
  mapping `.go` files to their directories; any non-Go path forces the full
  check. A Python or Rust project gets the full command every time, which is
  correct but slow.

## From ADR-004 (mrw leaves nothing in the working tree)

- **Pruning orphaned state directories.** Moving or deleting a checkout leaves
  its `$XDG_STATE_HOME/mrw/<key>/` behind. Each is a few hundred bytes and
  carries a `root` file naming the checkout it belonged to, so a human can see
  what is dead:
  `grep -r . "${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/mrw"/*/root`. No automatic
  reaper — deciding a directory is dead means deciding a path will never come
  back, and a tool should not decide that.

- **Windows conventions.** The state path is XDG-shaped; Windows would want
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%`. Nothing currently builds or tests mrw on Windows beyond
  cross-compiling the binary in CI, so this is unexercised rather than broken.

## Not tied to a record

- **The `human-decisions` amendment on shell file-writers.** Drafted 2026-08-31,
  awaiting M's approval. The workspace rule bans ad-hoc shell file-writers
  because gates keyed to `Edit`/`Write` cannot see a heredoc; the proposed
  narrowing exempts a single named tool that emits a machine-readable receipt,
  on the grounds that a `Bash` hook can match its name and read what it wrote.
  Evidence: `wing_craft/tooling` drawer
  `16b01a4c4c8a4448839ca08100cd63ca8e0ef0281193d0c8b6ac1c5688bcf0f7`. Not an ADR
  because it is a workspace-wide convention, not a decision about this
  repository.

- **Go-level coverage of `cmd/mrw`'s CLI wiring.** `cmd/mrw` has only
  `version_test.go`; pointer resolution in a hunk path and the exit-status
  mapping are covered end-to-end by `scripts/contract.sh` instead. Noted in
  ADR-003-T2 as a stated limitation rather than an oversight, but a Go test that
  execs the built binary would close it.

## From ADR-007 (mrw finds the files it serves)

- **A cross-file `--max-lines` budget.** The cap is per SPEC today — `read.Run`
  resets `budget := opt.MaxLines` for each one — and ADR-007's walk deduplicates
  so that it is per file for everything the walk produces. What nobody has
  decided is whether `mrw read --grep PAT .` over a large tree should have a
  budget for the WHOLE answer rather than per file, which is the number an agent
  paying for context actually cares about. No measurement taken; the shape of
  the answer probably depends on what T2's cost measurement says.

- **Parallel walking or searching.** ADR-007's walk reads every candidate to
  match it and then `read.Run` reads the matching ones again, serially. That is
  the price of `Run` staying the only reader that observes (ADR-005). If T2's
  go/no-go cost measurement comes back close to the 2× threshold, parallelism is
  the first thing to reach for — and it needs its own answer to whether output
  order stays deterministic, which the receipt format assumes.

## From ADR-008 (a delete says what it removed)

- **Requiring a guard on every `delete`.** ADR-008 makes a delete REPORT its
  bounds and lets it DECLARE an expected body, but leaves an unguarded
  `@@ f.go 5-8 delete` legal. Requiring `lines=` or `anchor=` was the runner-up
  and is genuinely close: it taxes every correct two-line delete to catch the
  rare wrong one. Revisit once the receipt bounds have been in use — if a wrong
  range still reaches a build after ADR-008, the tax is worth paying.

- **Requiring the expected body rather than accepting it.** The body is opt-in
  because it costs the caller the tokens of the lines being removed, which is
  worth it for a delete worth pinning and not for a two-line one. If plans in
  practice omit it exactly where it would have helped, that judgement is wrong
  and the default should move.

- **`anchor=` reports its failure above the ledger check, so a failed anchor
  reads one line of a range the caller was never served.** ADR-008 moved its own
  expected-removal comparison BELOW `covered()` for exactly this reason and
  pinned it with a test; its sibling one line up was noticed at the same time
  and deliberately left, so this entry exists to stop the asymmetry reading as
  an oversight. Reproduced 2026-09-01, `internal/apply/apply.go:453-456` — with
  `f.txt` served at line 3 only:

      FAIL f.txt 1 replace (plan line 1): anchor "nope" not in line 1: SECRET-LINE-ALPHA

  It fires on `replace` and `delete` alike, and is repeatable per address, so it
  is bounded by `clip`'s 60 characters per failed hunk rather than by one line
  in total. Two corrections to the reasoning that first justified leaving it,
  both from the PR #11 re-review. The gloss "the anchor is the caller's own
  text" does not hold for the half that matters: the anchor is theirs, the
  PRINTED LINE is the file's, and that is the part never served. In the other
  direction the blast radius is smaller than it looks — `--root` still refuses
  first, so nothing outside the tree mrw was pointed at is reachable. So this is
  a contract violation against ADR-002 and ADR-005's "mrw does not tell you what
  it has not shown you", not a privilege boundary: the caller could read the
  file directly. Fix by moving the anchor check below `covered()`, which is a
  one-line move plus the fixture that proves it — a fixture whose FIRST version
  must be checked against a mutant, because the obvious one trips the
  whole-file gate instead and passes with the ordering reversed.

# Task ADR-047-T1: The teaching already rides in ADR-040 help. This task is the receipt.

**Depends-on:** none
**Covers:** none — no spec
**Estimated scope:** S
**Owner:** unassigned
**Produces:** none
**Consumes:** none
**Data dependency:** hermetic
**Proof map:** v1
**Rests-on:** `the record existing`

## Goal

The teaching already rides in ADR-040 help. This task is the receipt.

## Affected Files

| File | Change | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| `cmd/mrw/main.go` | none — taught by 040 | body= stays lines |

## Ordered Steps

1. [S1] Confirm the Acceptance fence is RED if `**Status:** Accepted` or the record-only / measure-first phrase is deleted from this ADR. [proof: test]
2. [S2] Do not implement a parser, streamer, extra MCP tool, flock-on-Load, or LOCALAPPDATA move. [proof: acceptance]

## Acceptance

```bash
set -o pipefail
grep -F -q '**Status:** Accepted' docs/adr/ADR-047-python-str-is-taught-as-a-line-count.md \
  && grep -E -q 'record only|measurement only|measure first' docs/adr/ADR-047-python-str-is-taught-as-a-line-count.md
```

## Tests

| Test name | File | Verifies | Covers | Steps |
|-----------|------|----------|--------|-------|
| `Acceptance fence` | `docs/adr/ADR-047-python-str-is-taught-as-a-line-count.md` | Status is Accepted and the Decision names record-only or measure-first | — | S1 |

## Reachability

| Rung | How this task shows it |
|------|------------------------|
| 1 — exists | this record |
| 2 — something selects it | a later execute names this number |
| 3 — the caller can discover it | BACKLOG points here |
| 4 — it is used | nothing measures this yet — ADR-009 refused telemetry |

## Mutation Log

## Invariants

- No engine change this turn.
- Do not reopen ADR-019 B/C.
- Do not touch Playtrix.

## Risks

- Reading Accepted as implement. Mitigation: Stop Condition.

## Stop Condition

Stop if the proposed work is a parser, streamer, extra MCP tool, flock-on-Load, or LOCALAPPDATA move in this turn.

## Out of Scope

- Engine change (permanent: boundary: record only)
